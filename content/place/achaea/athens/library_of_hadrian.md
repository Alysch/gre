## Garden Description

The most monumental building dedicated to education and intellectual pursuits in Athens was the so-called Library of Hadrian (Fig. 1).  It consisted of four columned halls with exedrae at regular intervals on the north and south sides, and a library room flanked by lecture halls on the east.

In the center of the building was a large open peristyle courtyard with a long pool (stippled on plan).  The courtyard has been reconstructed as a garden (G on plan) in which students and scholars could stroll, and there were almost certainly statues in this area.  One is reminded of Vitruvius' recommendation to plant the open areas between the colonnades of buildings with greenery, which he believed improved the air and made walks in this environment healthy for body and mind [(Vitr. 5.9.5.)](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:5.9.5). The building bears a strong resemblance typologically, and very likely thematically, to the late Hellenistic/early Roman gymnasium outside the city in the Academy.  Pausanias, our literary source for Hadrian's building projects in Athens, referred to the library as a splendid building with 100 columns, adorned with statues and paintings [(Paus. 1.18.9)](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.18.9).
